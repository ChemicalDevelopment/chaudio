# chaudio

chaudio is an audio library (chemicaldevelopment audio) in C with (planned) python bindings.

Meant to be mainly for signal manipulation rather than composing, but can be used that way programmatically.


Planned features:

  * Efficient python bindings
  * Implementations of common effects (filters, EQ, echo, delay, reverb, etc)
  * A programming language (similar to Csound, but more generalized)
