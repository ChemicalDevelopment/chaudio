Installing
==========

chaudio is available as a pip package.

python3 is suggested, but it is python2 compatable.

So, either:


.. code-block:: sh

    pip3 install chaudio

Or, for python2 installation:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install chaudio


Note that this requires scipy and numpy to be installed, which sometimes requires system libraries.

To install on a Debian based system (such as Ubuntu), first run:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python3-scipy

Or, for python2 installation:


.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python-scipy


Once you've ran this, rerun the pip installation command for chaudio
